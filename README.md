This repository contains the code and documentation for a grade project developed at the Jaime Isaza Cadavid Polytechnic. The main goal of this project is to simplify the process of loading data from Excel files into QuickSight using DevSecOps and Cloud Engineering practices.

## Project Description

The project focuses on automating the data loading process from Excel files into QuickSight. This automation aims to streamline the process and reduce the possibility of errors in data visualization and analysis in QuickSight. The general workflow involves downloading files from Google Spreadsheet, saving them to an AWS S3 bucket, and formatting the data for integration into QuickSight.

## Implemented Technologies

The project makes use of the following technologies:

- **Ubuntu 20.04**: This operating system is used in the GitHub Actions workflow for task automation.
- **Python 3.11.5**: It is the primary language used for developing Lambdas and scripts for handling spreadsheets.
